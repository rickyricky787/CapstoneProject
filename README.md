# CapstoneProject
A porfolio optimization project, where it predicts the closing stock value for several stocks for the next 60 days using linear regression and reinforcement learning.

### Team Members:
- Javed Rafiuddin
- Ricky Rodriguez
- Samuel Khong
- Jiayao Zhou

### Requirements
- Python (perferably 3.4 or above)

### How to Run
1. On terminal, install the required Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file. This can be done by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the terminal.
2. Run `python3 stock_predictor.py`. This will output several .csv files containing predicted closing stock values for the next 60 days.
3. Run 'stockdrl.py' to run the reinforcement learning portion. This is only ran with the AMC prediction so make sure that the 'AMC_pred' is in the same folder.
